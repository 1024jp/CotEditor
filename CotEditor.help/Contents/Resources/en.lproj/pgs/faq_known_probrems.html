<h1>Are there any known issues?</h1>
<p>There are some known issues as listed below. These should be taken care of in the future releases, but solutions to them are not yet in sight.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the Line Endings drop-down menu on the toolbar is opened, no check mark appears next to the selected item.</li>
<li>When Line Spacing is set bigger than 0, the underlines, that Japanese input methods show during Kana-Kanji conversion, are displayed lower than usual.</li>
<li>When &ldquo;Fix line height with composite font&rdquo; is turned on, white lines may appear between the lines inside the selection (i.e. the background-color can be seen through).</li>
<li>If you selected Cancel in the authentication window of &ldquo;authopen&rdquo; when saving, error logs are output to console. (&ldquo;authopen&rdquo; is the name of a helper application which is launched by CotEditor.)</li>
<li>When print previewing on 10.3.9, an error saying that &ldquo;Can't create CMap Adobe-Identity-UCS2.&rdquo; is output to console.</li>
<li>When completing words on 10.3.9, after typing only one letter and showing the completion list (usually by pressing F5), pressing Enter doesn't select an item.</li>
<li>When completing words on 10.3.9, pressing ESC doesn't pop up the completion list.</li>
</ul>
