<h1>Count characters in CotEditor</h1>

<p>CotEditor has a feature to live-count characters in the document during editing.</p>


<h2>Standard character count</h2>

<p>CotEditor can display the character count both in the status bar and the document inspector. By the standard character count, it counts each grapheme cluster, that is defined as the extended grapheme cluster in Unicode.</p>

<p>A grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode code points that should be treated as a single unit for humans. For instance, while a normal character, such as A, is naturally counted as one character, an emoji consisting of multiple Unicode code points, such as 1️⃣ (<code>U+0031</code> <code>U+FE0F</code> <code>U+20E3</code>), will also be counted as one character.</p>


<h2>Advanced character count</h2>

<p>From the Advanced Character Count command in the Text menu, you can count characters in various ways.</p>
