<h1>Specification Changes on CotEditor 2.2</h1>

<p>CotEditor 2.2 includes some specification changes from the previous versions in order to conform to the Sandbox rules. If you've used the legacy version before, you may need some manual migrations.</p>


<h2>Scripts Folder Location</h2>
<p>Due to the Sandbox requirements, the scripts folder location moved from <code>~/Library/Application Support/CotEditor/ScriptMenu/</code> to <code>~/Library/Application Scripts/com.coteditor.CotEditor/</code>. Users need to migrate their script to the new folder manually, since CotEditor doesn't have the write permission to the new location.</p>
