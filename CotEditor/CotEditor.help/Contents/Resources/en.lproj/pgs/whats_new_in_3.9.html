<h1>What's New in CotEditor 3.9</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>Invisible characters with more accuracy</dt>
	<dd>The drawing method for invisible characters has been revamped so that the symbols are displayed in accurate and natural positions under a variety of environments, such as proportional fonts, right-to-left writing direction, and vertical text orientation. In addition, the width of the tab characters can now be known at a glance.</dd>
	
	<dt>Faster, faster!</dt>
	<dd>Since the latter updates of CotEditor 3.8.x series including this CotEditor 3.9.0, CotEditor made a bunch of performance optimizations in various areas.</dd>
