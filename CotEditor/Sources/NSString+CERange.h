/*
 Negative location accesses elements from the end of element counting backwards.
 e.g. `location == -1` is the last character / last.
 
 Likewise, negative length can be used to select rest elements except the last one element.
 e.g. `location: 3`, `length: -1` where string has 10 lines.
       -> element 3 to 9 (NSRange(3, 6)) will be retruned
 
 
 Well, this category is not so useful as you thought.

 Return character range for line location/length allowing negative value.
 
 @param location   Index of the first line in range. The line location starts not with 0 but with 1.
                   Passing 0 to the location will return NSNotFound.
 @param length     Number of lines to include.
 
 @return Character range, or NSRange(NSNotFound, 0) if the given values are out of range.
 
 @note The last line break will be included.
